# Samples

Each folder in this directory represents a small sample designed to illustrate one specific feature or use of Aggregates.NET.  They each contain 3 projects, one as a "client," one as a "domain," and one which contains messages and event definitions.

The domain and client projects contain a "endpoint" file which contains code to start and configure nservicebus - they are not very interesting and contain no sample code.

Please see readme files in each directory for more info.
